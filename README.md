# Smart-Irrigation-System
Designed and developed an automated smart irrigation system using the PIC16F877A microcontroller. Through ADC conversion, the device continuously measures the moisture content of the soil and regulates a water pump accordingly. The motor is turned ON or OFF based on a preset threshold to optimize water usage.
